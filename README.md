# expectations

i'm just bored and suffering. i think i have diabetes.  ddint' think that thing would get me.  or i'm at like the limits or some shit.  so tiring fool.  and you choke me and it makes me fatter.  can't stand pain or something.  makes everything ten times more difficult.

so what has your world looked like this past few years???  i did very much to change it i wonder the results.  cause if you were doing this shit, i would totally expect your asses to do something right for wasting so much time i lost track of what was going on.
