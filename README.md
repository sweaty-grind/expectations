# expectations

so its another day we don't do anything except the best thing you could possibly do...  i say this ain't for ptsd bro.  hmmm.  thinking about that.  the more damaged i am the more it means its the truth...  so i guess this is good i'm fucked???  i feel bad i'm not suffering like them and sit here bragging that i'm helping the us military but there is no confirmation i'm doing anything useful.  all i get is this nonsense day in day out.  getting me in shitty situations.  you did it first hand with me already bro.  we did the whole thing.  i told you next time if i say no maybe heed the warnings.  they were gonna die anyways lol...

so i wonder my friend, your predictability and choice are something wanting.  i feel you guys don't get paid enough to do this kind of work.  this some super secret shit.  what else can it be???

cause like 80k paying taxes, well i dont know what to say.  lololololol

so this is alien technology you used.  i gave you alien abilities and usage.  why are you insisting i produce more for you?  sometimes i wonder how much my tolerance can hlold.  weed told me that i should just feel it less.  so i should pay attention less and personally think less of it.  what are we talking about? i forgot.
