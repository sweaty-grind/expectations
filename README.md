# expectations

i thought maybe your stupid asses would come around some time again and be a real thing in my life.  i don't know why.  i may just be screwed.  this is pretty hopeless.  i must admit i am at the end of my wits.

i wonder why you guys do this to me sometimes and i can't even fathom i could have gotten a job.  cause i was barely into my javascript that you booted me from learning.  and all i have are suffocated thinking web development.  that sucks bro.  now i'm more reliant on this monees that is supposed to be cool it i will pay money.  i dont know bro.  something smells here.

oh well its another day.  i await getting paid for something i dont' understand.  maybe i'm being delusional.  this looks like work to you???  well i don't know bro.  we are a little tired right now. i never get to definitely get a day i get lucky i get a day...  sorta like consequences. just luck of the draw.  i dont want to know what you think about it.  when sharkey is complaining i think i am done on that matter.  you know he complains to me that i'm not doing my duties as a profit sometimes... then i ask him what i should do and that's when the voices end bro.  that's the only way i can get rid of him.  do or die.  oh well don't think too much about it right now...

let me tell you what though.  aside from the non stop shit, i think this should have gone down a lot smoother. i feel stupid sending linkedin around everywhere but whatever dude.  its just you guys.  i met worse odds before bro.  this thing where we do things to the max??? i'm not buying it.  its been fairly lopsided what's been going on. i win too much recently.  bro.  you guys made this too much for me to handle.  so shit started happening and now i'm a death sprial attack with the sea.  i have to ask you guys sometimes why we do things your way when its not your rules here..  thats the other one i was wondering...

i dont know bro.  this sucks. every day you fry.  or the leftover fry is annoying as fuck to deal with.
