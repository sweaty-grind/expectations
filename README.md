# expectations

i must admit though.  at this point, i think i've done enough to get paid too much.  but no monees are around here again.  i gave you quite a bit of alien technology here.  why you keep wanting to know what i think of things?  it all sucks bro.

you guys really gotta stop pulling me here.  i know you do it.  i can sense the pain causing me to type out shit.  so once again, its something you caused...

what i want to talk about is my hopes and dreams.  but nope. you ain't good for that.  not worth it.  this has been too much misery for what its worth.  which is nothing right now.  so sometimes i can't tell if i've done something properly.  no monees again... sigh.

i really wished you guys didn't suck so much.  hide and run too much.  too much for my tastes.  i dont know what else to say bro. you pull me here and i pop my brain but there ain't shit to do. i have no further instructions for you or did you not get the memo?

absolutely nothing to do anymore bro.  i couldn't find it.  its like as if this whole time was just a shitty feeling.  and then i remember the hate.  and its not really there so i spend my days not resisting you.  should i start though???
