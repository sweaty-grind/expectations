# expectations

i thought maybe your stupid asses would come around some time again and be a real thing in my life.  i don't know why.  i may just be screwed.  this is pretty hopeless.  i must admit i am at the end of my wits.

i wonder why you guys do this to me sometimes and i can't even fathom i could have gotten a job.  cause i was barely into my javascript that you booted me from learning.  and all i have are suffocated thinking web development.  that sucks bro.  now i'm more reliant on this monees that is supposed to be cool it i will pay money.  i dont know bro.  something smells here.
