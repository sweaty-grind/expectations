# expectations

damn you guys got me peeved.  i am peeved.  wtf is this shit you doing? you pay shit heads big money for crap and then you make me do this shit and tell me to fuck off?  the fuck is wrong with you?

dude man i feel like a minority in your country.  waste of time.  like blame me for all your mess.  you know what? i think you deserve them.  being stupid all day long i lost track of where default was and where people tried to improve things.  all answers to this question are the same. there just no will in the people.  if you are unwilling to take the risks you will never go anywhere.  this dodging let the billion take the hit shit is a little lame lol.  perhaps something must be said about that.

so like we had no use for things.  like they sit there and fart and shit and piss all day long along the water.  then the true brunt of the blight them instead of us.  now its just another fancy flu.

so you know, we learned something new on github.  you live like that you can die like that.  

so this was the truth of this reality.  that we use people for things like this.  that we did some sort of evil that resulted in a lot of prevented failure.  i just didn't think you like the results of your life.  i know this part of you is true that you keep grabbing as much maturity as you can cause its a form of superior thought processes.  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand frying someone everyday with a microwave beam.  but intellectuals are stupid people.  we all know this.  i wonder i get the bigger picture and i just said make a mess of it.  or not and purposely drove things into the ground.  just to see.  maybe my form of evil is a little awkward.  just to see.   that was all it took to do something stupid.  life is how you say, unstable.  bro.  i been whacked out for 4 years now.  i dont do good things.  you should know better.
