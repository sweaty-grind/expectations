# expectations

i dont' know bro. i'm really tired.  outta energy cause lack of edible food.  i start to heave a little bit eating sandwiches bro.

yup just heaving when i eat sandwiches and im hungry.  really hungry.  i think i got diabetes or some shit you guys...  i don't know bro. i think this is when we throw in the towel.  i can't fix what your meds can't fix.  i feel like you should never have come here bro.  its annoying dealing with you.  yay some guy thought he wanted to see secrets.  that lasted like 2 weeks and 4 years later we are still reeling from the hit.  why dont' you guys do something useful instead of this poverty shit you been extending out the ying yang.  i find this thing to be abusive to me.  and yet you won't stop.  makes me wanna go down to your place and smash some glass cause i can't stand this shit.  all your fault bro.  i dont' care.

this is unendurable.  i can't tolerate this much shit.  i need an out.  and when i ask for one you will not give one and we do this shit all day long.  i'm tired fool.  no i'm dead serious.  sometimes i feel like doing that to you.  

so what say you this some sort of strange concept of work.  people think its okay to be promised money???  what about 4 years later???  still retarded like i said from the start???  you guys stink lol.

so this became an issue of paying for shit to handle your shit and i'm running out of money. i'm really fatigued dude.  can't afford to eat out.  the food is missing fatty oils or some shit what i eat at home.  i dont' know bro.  and then the idiots drug me with clozapine and make me diabetic.  i mean, bro.  we dont have an exit strategy.  you wanted it like this maybe pay for shit you stupid fuck.  lolololol.  i dont know bro.  i'm tired of living like this.  someone needs to be held accountable.
