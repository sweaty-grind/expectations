# expectations

damn you guys got me peeved.  i am peeved.  wtf is this shit you doing? you pay shit heads big money for crap and then you make me do this shit and tell me to fuck off?  the fuck is wrong with you?

dude man i feel like a minority in your country.  waste of time.  like blame me for all your mess.  you know what? i think you deserve them.  being stupid all day long i lost track of where default was and where people tried to improve things.  all answers to this question are the same. there just no will in the people.  if you are unwilling to take the risks you will never go anywhere.  this dodging let the billion take the hit shit is a little lame lol.  perhaps something must be said about that.

so like we had no use for things.  like they sit there and fart and shit and piss all day long along the water.  then the true brunt of the blight them instead of us.  now its just another fancy flu.

so you know, we learned something new on github.  you live like that you can die like that.
